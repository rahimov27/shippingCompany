    //What should I do
    //1) find total volume of each item
    //2) find volume of two containers (big container volume is:75.58733699999999) +
    // (small container volume is:38.139821999999995) +
    //3) find sum of volume for all items (create arraylist and find sum) +
    //4.1) find weight of all items
    //4) then find best way of dividing volume, I should sum of
    // itemsVolume divide for volume of containers
    //5) for example sumOfAllVolumeOfItems will be 399,88 cube meter
    //6) the volume of small container is 38.1398, and volume of big container is 75.5873
    // first method 399.88 divide 75.58 = (approximately 5 big containers with price 1800 euro)
    // second method 399.88 divide 38.1398 = (approximately 10 small containers with price 1000 euro)
    // price of first method is 5 big * 1800 euro = 9000 euro, 375 volume
    // price of second method is 10 small * 1000 euro = 10000 euro, 380 volume
    // price of third method will be 4 big containers = 4 * 1800 (7200 euro) volume 302
    //7) find totalWeight of all items ()
